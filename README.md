Solving conflict:

1. Read the merge conflic warning.
2. "Merge" to fetch the confict and allow solving. "Rebase" rewrites the changes. "Fast-forward" discard the change and fetch the newer version.
3. Set the config with --global to remember it and auto apply in the future.
4. With "Merge", git pull and solve the conflict and push it.

Using force pull or force push:

- Do the pull first before coding to avoid the merge conflict.
- Force push if the remote codes version is broken.
- Force pull if the local codes version is broken.
- Will overwrite the other codes.
